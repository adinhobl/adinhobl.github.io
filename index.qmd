:::{#about}
I am an experienced engineer with diverse experience building ML systems at startups and scale ups. My interests lie in generative modeling, deep learning, and ML applied to science. I enjoy working at the intersection of research, data, and product.

In a previous life, I was a chemical engineer, designing and constructing manufacturing plants.

Here's my [resume](resume.qmd) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-dinhobl/) if they interest you.

When I'm not at work, I enjoy climbing, fantasy or scifi audiobooks, and hanging around with friends.
