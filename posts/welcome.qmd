Welcome! I've toyed around with the idea of starting a blog for a while, but somehow this go-around finally pushed me past the tipping point, and now that I've clicked publish, it's done.

A bit about me. I recently moved to Boston from Houston, with a year in San Diego in between. 

I arrived just in time for a nice fall and my first truly snowy winter!

Boston's definitely different from other places I've lived, with many incredible libraries, universities, meetups. Oh, and the T - I've been looking forward to living with public transport for a while, and so far I'm not disappointed.


Some other things tech I'm interested in at the moment and will probably write more about:  

- I'm really liking [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and its flexibility. This website was relatively easy to make, and the guides are great.  
    - I made a presentation with it recently, and while it's a different process than Google Slides, some functionality was pretty neat.  

- I'm pretty interested in [FastHTML](https://fastht.ml/). I haven't done much web programming in the past, but I've recently been making more demos and dashboards for research projects, and I'm hoping to get to use it more.  
- RL applied to language models, both in the RLHF sense, and in the verifiability sense. R1 is pretty cool, and I'm excited to see where the field goes.  
- [dLLM](https://x.com/InceptionAILabs/status/1894847919624462794) - I'm alwasy interested in learning about makes me want to learn more about diffusion models.
